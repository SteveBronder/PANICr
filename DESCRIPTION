Title: PANIC Tests of Nonstationarity
Description: A methodology that makes use of the factor structure of large
    dimensional panels to understand the nature of nonstationarity inherent
    in data. This is referred to as PANIC, Panel Analysis of Nonstationarity
    in Idiosyncratic and Common Components. PANIC (2004) includes valid
    pooling methods that allow panel tests to be constructed. PANIC (2004)
    can detect whether the nonstationarity in a series is pervasive,
    or variable specific, or both. PANIC (2010) includes two new tests
    on the idiosyncratic component that estimates the pooled autoregressive
    coefficient and sample moment, respectively. The PANIC model approximates
    the number of factors based on Bai and Ng (2002).
